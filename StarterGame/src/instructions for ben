1) Create a new game
-	link to it from the title screen
-	set up character movement with key bindings
-	set up collision if you need it
-	basically- copy the first game

2) Create a computer player for the first game
-	make a computer class
-	extend from the object class
-	make two instance variables, the coordinates of the treasure
-	overwrite move() from the object class and make the computer
	move to the treasure. it should look like:
		
		public void move(){
			<calculate best dx and dy>
			super.move();
		}
		
-	remove the second player from the game class, stick in a
	computer object instead, and update the move/draw/collision
	methods to reflect the change		
-   in the relocate() method, update the computer's treasure
	coordinates whenever you relocate the treasure
	
3) In the first game, make a toggle between 1P and 2P
-	have a boolean variable that decides whether its 1P or 2P
-	set up a key that, on release, switches the boolean
-	if the boolean is true, handle the game as 2P
-	if the boolean is false, handle the game as 1P
