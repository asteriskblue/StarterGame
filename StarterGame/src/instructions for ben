Explanation of computer logic.

The game updates every 10 milliseconds. Each time, the move() function of each player is called.
Objects move according to their dx and dy (delta x and delta y). Human players set these values with key presses.
Computer players set these values with their own special calculations.

By rewriting the computer class' move() function, we can have the computer players calculate the proper dx and dy.
Since computer players keep track of the treasure location with tx and ty, they know where to move.
If they need to move right, they move right. If they need to move up, they move up.

This is how it all happens. When the handler's (map2's) move() function is called...

	human player's move() is called
	dx and dy are already set by button presses (or lack of)
	dx and dy are added to x and y
	
	computer player's move() is called
	dx and dy are decided according to the computer players position relative to the treasure
	dx and dy are added to x and y
	
As you can see, both players are constantly moving at the same time with the same speed.
Everything is dependent on those two values, dx and dy, that make things move.
